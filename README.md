# de.ubisys
Homey Zigbee driver for Ubisys devices

This is the first release.

Beware that this release does not offer the possibility to configure the input-types for the modules.
This isn't supported yet in the ZigBee implementation by Athom.
So read the manuals of the devices at www.ubisys.de in order to know if you have the switches that are by default set in the configuration of the devices on delivery or ask the supplier if he can set it for you.
